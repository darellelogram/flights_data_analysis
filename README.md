## Some code to analyse and visualise flights data
Main focus is on the relationship between utilization rates and flight delay profiles. Pre-processing done in R, and visualization done with Tableau.

Also did some simple web scraping using Python libraries (PhantomJS and BeautifulSoup) to get the aircraft models based on the individual aeroplane tail numbers, with the intention of analysing the differences in dealy profiles across aircraft models. However, this will have to remain a #TODO for now.
